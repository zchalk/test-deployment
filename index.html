        <section class="faqs">
            <h2>FAQ's</h2>
            <h3>Are any topics off limits? Yes!</h3>
            <p>Talks are thoughtful, not divisive:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>No talks with an inflammatory political or religious agenda, nor polarizing "us vs them" language.</li>
                <li>We seek to build consensus and provide outside-the-box thinking, not to revisit familiar, unresolvable disputes on these topics.</li>
                <li>Speakers cannot promote their own products, books, or businesses, or those of a company which employs them.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>If selected, can I use PowerPoint slides for my presentation?</h3>
            <p>Minimal. No more than 6 basic slides. The focus should be on you, not your PowerPoint slides. Watch the most viewed Ted Talks and you will see that slides are used sparingly.</p>
            <p>This is a speech from the heart. You may not read or pre-record your speech.</p>

            <h3>How much does it cost to attend the event?</h3>
            <p>Admission is free. Seating is limited. Reservations required. We anticipate a sold-out event, so reserve early!</p>

            <h3>If selected, can I choose the order of when I speak?</h3>
            <p>No, the committee will determine the order of speakers.</p>

            <h3>What if I can't stay for the entire event?</h3>
            <p>Don't apply. It would be disrespectful to the rest of the speakers if you left before everyone spoke.</p>

            <h3>Will the event be recorded?</h3>
            <p>Yes, and your talk will be uploaded to YouTube.</p>

            <h3>Will the event be Livestreamed?</h3>
            <p>Yes. Link will be provided on the website.</p>
            <p>If selected, you will be required to sign a media release form.</p>

            <h3>Any tips for my proposal?</h3>
            <p>What do you want the audience to understand?</p>
            <p>Remember Ted Talk motto: "Ideas Worth Spreading"</p>
